# Programming Basics
===================================

## Introduction
Hello there, and welcome to programming basics! In this section we will cover the basic foundational knowledge that is imperative for all programmers to know. These building blocks are required for all kinds of applications and is what makes up basically any program that you would use in the real world.

### Why Learn Programming?
Modern society has evolved to a state where there is fancy technology all around us. It's integrated so firmly in our lives that we sometimes don't even realize they are there. From the cars we drive to the complex devices we hold in our hands everyday (some of us spend too much time using these), all of these things require software for us to use them. It is becoming increasingly important that people should know at least a little about programming to get some understanding of how the tech we use works.
