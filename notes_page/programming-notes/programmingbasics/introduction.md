# Programming Basics



### Introduction
Hello there, and welcome to programming basics! In this section we will cover the basic foundational knowledge that is imperative for all programmers to know. These building blocks are required for all kinds of applications and is what makes up basically any program that you would use in the real world.



### Why Learn Programming?
Modern society has evolved to a state where there is fancy technology all around us. It's integrated so firmly in our lives that we sometimes don't even realize they are there. From the cars we drive to the complex devices we hold in our hands everyday (some of us spend too much time using these), all of these things require software for us to use them. It is becoming increasingly important that people should know at least a little about programming to get some understanding of how the tech we use works.

### About This Section
In any field or subject, it is important for one to have a strong grasp of the fundamentals - creating a wide and sturdy foundation allows the building of knowledge to be built much higher, and much more stable. This section will cover all the basics of programming, and I will provide code examples in Java and Python, two very common starting out languages. Let's get started!
